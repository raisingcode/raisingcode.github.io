## Introduction
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) simplifies Kubernetes management, but troubleshooting issues is essential for production stability. This guide outlines common issues and efficient troubleshooting strategies.

## Common AKS Issues

- **Cluster Creation Failures**
- **Pod Scheduling Problems**
- **Networking Errors**
- **Scaling Issues**
- **Node Health and Performance**

## Tools for Troubleshooting AKS
- Azure Monitor
- Kubernetes Dashboard
- `kubectl` commands
- Log Analytics and Diagnostics

## Troubleshooting Steps for Each Issue

### Cluster Creation Failures
- Review activity logs in Azure.
- Validate Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.

### Pod Scheduling Problems
- Check taints, tolerations, and node availability.
- Use `kubectl describe pod`.

### Networking Errors
- Diagnose with `kubectl get services` and `kubectl get ingress`.
- Verify Network Security Group (NSG) rules.

### Scaling Issues
- Inspect Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) metrics.
- Check quota limits and available resources.

### Node Health and Performance
- Use Azure Advisor for recommendations.
- Investigate node conditions with `kubectl describe node`.

## Pro Tips for Efficient Troubleshooting
- Use Azure Resource Health for quick status checks.
- Automate recurring checks with scripts.
- Leverage AKS diagnostics and self-healing mechanisms.

## Resources for Further Learning
- [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com)
- [Kubernetes Official Troubleshooting Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/)
- Community tools like K9s and Lens.
